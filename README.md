# Smart Shuffle

This application shuffles any Spotify album or playlist while retaining the order of songs that are flagged as sequential.

### First Things First, Authorization!

Get the client id and secret from the [Spotify developer console](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
Go into this repository and stick the credentials as environment variables by running the following commands:

```
export SPOTIFY_SMART_SHUFFLE_CLIENT_ID=<CLIENT_ID>
export SPOTIFY_SMART_SHUFFLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<CLIENT_SECRET>
```
